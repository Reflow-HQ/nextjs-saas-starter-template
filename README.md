## Connecting a Database

The project includes a simple proof-of-concept task management app. It is built using a [Vercel Postgres](https://vercel.com/storage/postgres) database, but you can connect to any other serverless DB provider or a local database by modifying the [schema.prisma](./prisma/schema.prisma) configuration file.

Whenever you make changes to your schema run `npm run migrate-dev` to update your database and generate prisma client types.
